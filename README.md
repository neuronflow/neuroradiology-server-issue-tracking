# neuroradiology-server-issue-tracking

Dear readers,

I created a slack channel to coordinate the usage of the new neuroradiology server and invited you. Please feel free to add users if you think they should be part of this channel.

For the moment we will track issues with the server on GitHub:
https://github.com/neuronflow/neuroradiology-server-issue-tracking

Also have a look at the server rules:
https://github.com/neuronflow/neuroradiology-server-issue-tracking/blob/main/rules.md#server-rules

This should help us ensure that no issues are forgotten.


Be aware that this is a public repository for the moment. Please create an issue if you want the repo to go private and provide all GitHub user accounts which should be added to the repo when doing so.


Furthermore, it might help us to stick to GitHub's code of conduct when reporting issues.

It's my first time acting as a server administrator, so I am thanking you in advance for your tolerance and understanding towards my slow and hopefully steep learning curve.


Best,
Florian
