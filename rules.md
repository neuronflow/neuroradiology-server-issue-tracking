# server rules
the server rules are defined in a strictly democractic procedure by the server administration.

## issue tracking
Issues are reported using this GitHub's repository issue tracking system:
https://github.com/neuronflow/neuroradiology-server-issue-tracking/issues

This includes issues, with these rules.

## no students
No students, get access to the server or run code on it, without explicit permission to be given on a project-basis.

## user accounts
One person, one user account. No exceptions.

## provide contact details when running code on the server
make sure your contact details are provided to the server administration and that you are reachable. Otherwise your computation might be canceled without prior notice.

## work in progress
current rules are a work in progress and subject to change.
